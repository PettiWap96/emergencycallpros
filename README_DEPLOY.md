# Emergency Call Pros â€” Landing Page

This is a one-page, static site designed to help you pass affiliate-network approvals (MarketCall, ResultCalls, Inquirly) by demonstrating a professional presence with clear compliance language.

## Quick Deploy (fastest)
1) Go to **https://app.netlify.com/drop**  
2) Drag-and-drop the folder in this zip.  
3) Netlify will give you a live URL.  
4) Click **Domain settings** to add your custom domain (after you buy it).

## Custom Domain
1) Buy: **emergencycallpros.com** (or alternatives: `rapidresponsecalls.com`, `urgentserviceconnect.com`).  
2) In your domain registrar DNS, add a CNAME to your Netlify site target.  
3) Enable HTTPS in Netlify.

## Branded Email
- Use Zoho Mail or Google Workspace to create `partners@emergencycallpros.com` on your domain.  
- Update the email in `index.html` if you change it.

## Customize
- Replace business name and email in `index.html` (search for "Emergency Call Pros").
- Replace `assets/logo.svg` if desired.
- Edit copy: specialize verticals, compliance notes, and CTA.

## Notes
- The contact form uses Netlify Forms (works automatically on Netlify).  
- If you deploy elsewhere, replace the form with Formspree or your own endpoint.
